## Project Detailing
### Details
Take a Seat was a project created following the Java EE concepts in order to generate a software to sell tickets for Events. Into this, you as an Administrator is able to create your own event, specifying how many tickets will be available to sell, how many categories of tickets will your event have, and also how much they will cost. Any event can be posted at Take a Seat: from a small party to a big concert. Customers that want to buy a ticket will need to log-in into the System and select the tickets they want, from that event. They'll have access to their schedule, in which they can see the events they will be participating.

Every ticket is created alongside with a unique QR Code. Another application was created, the Ticket Validator, that should be used by the Administrators at the entrance of the event to check if the QR Code at the Ticket being presented is valid. The information about validity will be showed at the screen.
